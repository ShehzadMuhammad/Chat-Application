# Chat-Application
A simple chat application made with NodeJs and Express using Socket.Io, right now the application is working and later on I might add some more features.

to use, install the files, and also install the node modules with npm init and from there just hit npm run start in the command terminal and go to localhost:3000 and the program should be up.
